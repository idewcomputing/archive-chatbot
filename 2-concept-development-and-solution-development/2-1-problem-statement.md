# 2-1 Problem Statement

## Objective

Develop a concise problem statement for your chatbot project.

## Instructions

While the problem statement should be brief and concise, that doesn't mean it should be hastily written. There is a lot to think about as you formulate your statement, but having a coherent statement will provide your team needed focus and ultimately a better result.

**Three Parts to the Problem Statement** Use the following three sentences as a template for your problem statement.

* We have observed that `[this current situation]` isn’t meeting `[these goals/needs]` for `[these people]`, which is causing `[this adverse effect]`. 
* Our chatbot, `[chatbot name]`, will provide `[these services]` and provide `[these improvements]`. 
* We will measure our success based on `[these measurable criteria]`.

> **Example Statement:** We have observed that searching on Google for burrito recipes \(or local restaurants offering burritos\) isn't convenient or fun for "20-somethings", which is limiting the use of online recipe sites and visits to local restaurants offering burritos. Our chatbot, BigBurritioBot, will provide recommendations for burrito recipes based on ingredients, provide ingredient calculations based on the number of servings needed, and link maps to local burrito-serving restaurants and lead to more burrito recipes being enjoyed and more business for local restaurants serving burritos. We will measure our success based on reaching a 50% reduction in time to search a burrito recipe, demonstrating that 80% of users finding our chatbot more enjoyable to use than doing a standard Google search, and users believe they are more likely to eat a burrito at home or a restaurant due to our chatbot.
