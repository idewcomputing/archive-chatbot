# 2-4 Sample Database

## Objective

Build a sample database in Google Sheets of data your chatbot can retrieve for users.

## Instructions

1. Determine what type of information will be most valuable for your chatbot experience.
2. Focus on the attributes \(columns\) that will be important and generate a few examples \(rows\). You do not want to focus on getting a lot of data just yet.

> For example, if part of your chatbot function is to provide access to a glossary of terms, your data table may look something like this.
>
> | ID | Term | Category | Definition |
> | :---: | :---: | ---: | ---: |
> | 0 | variable | computing | a variable or scalar is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name \(an identifier\), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. |
> | 1 | normal distribution | data | a function that represents the distribution of many random variables as a symmetrical bell-shaped graph. |
> | 2 | prototype | design | A simulation or sample version of a final product, which is used for testing prior to launch. |

## âœ“ Deliverable

Document your sample database in a shared spreadsheet for later use.
