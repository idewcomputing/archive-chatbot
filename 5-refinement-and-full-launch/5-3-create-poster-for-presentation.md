# 5-3 Create Poster for Presentation

## Objective

Design and finalize a poster that provides a concise overview of what your team created, how you created it, and your evaluation of the final product.

## Instructions

Your team will create a poster \(36” wide by 24” tall\) that summarizes your chatbot project. This poster will be printed and used at the year-end event as part of your presentation and demonstration.

1. Use an application like Google Drawing to create your poster.
2. Ensure that you poster incorporates elements of your team's work that provides a full story of the work you have done. Consider the following items. 
   * Team Name and School
   * Team Members
   * Chatbot Name/Title
   * Sample of Task Analysis
   * Problem Statement/Proposal
   * Samples of Pseudo-code and Sample Dialogue
   * Sample of Database
   * Sample of Chatbot Script
   * Sample of JS Functions
   * Screenshot of Chatbot Interface
   * Summary of evaluations and conclusions
3. Use clear headings to organize your poster. Like `Research`, `Conceptualization`, `Prototyping`, `Development`, and `Evaluation`.
4. Evaluate your poster for legibility, readability, and overall impact of the message.
5. Get some informal feedback on your poster from people outside of your group and then refine as needed.
