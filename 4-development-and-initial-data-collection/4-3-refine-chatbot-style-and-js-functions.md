# 4-3 Refine Chatbot Style and JS Functions

### Objective

Carefully refine the style and user experience of the chatbot's visual and audio interactions. Code the functions needed for the various ways you chatbot will filter, sort, or process the database data.

## Instructions

1. Incrementally refine the visual and audio style of the chatbot and evaluate at each step by requesting feedback from within the team and from people outside of your team.
2. Code and test the Javascript functions needed to execute the chatbot script dialogue to meet the user's goals.

### âœ“ Deliverable

Demonstrate that your chatbot presents well on different screen sizes and under various environments \(for example, ensure the contrast is good under bright lights\). Also demonstrate that the chatbot script pathways are supported by the JS functions/database connection.
