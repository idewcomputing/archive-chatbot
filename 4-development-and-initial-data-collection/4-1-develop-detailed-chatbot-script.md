# 4-1 Develop Detailed Chatbot Script

### Objective

Implement chatbot triggers and responses that will cover the many various paths users may take and the variations in language they may use.

## Instructions

1. Simply start from the beginning of the chatbot dialogue and consider all the various paths and words a user may use to accomplish a goal. Use the Rivescript syntax to account for these variations.
2. Consider how to implement a fallback for users that they can always fall back to intuitively. For example, you may want to listen for keywords like "help" to trigger some general guidance. You may also consider having an ever-present "?" button the user could use as a last resort.
3. Conduct continuous evaluation by testing your changes on members of your team and others outside of your team.

### âœ“ Deliverable

Demonstrate that your chatbot script is resilient to the ways people may interact with it.
