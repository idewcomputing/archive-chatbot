# 1-3 Select Single Concept

## Objective

Conduct a thorough evaluation of your three concepts and select a single concept to develop for the project.

## Instructions

1. Discuss each concept's viability along the following dimensions. Consider scoring each concept on a scale of one to five on each of these for comparison. You could do this as individuals and then share, or you could do it as a group.
   * **How interested are the team members in the topic?** Will each team member be emotionally invested in the project?
   * **Will the concept attract a good number of users and maintain interest?** Remember there is always competition for people's attention. Will your concept draw people in for one reason or another? Do you see a way to "brand" your chatbot?
   * **Does the concept seem technically feasible to implement?** Do you feel that the logic and data can be reasonably developed by the team?
   * **Is there enough work to be done for your team to share responsibilities?** Avoid starting a project that is too simplistic in purpose and scope.
   * **Can the concept fit the** [**project requirements**](../team-project-outline.md)**?** Do a quick review of the project requirements to avoid obvious problems.
2. Choose a single concept for the team to pursue. You definitely want all team members on board with the direction. If your team is unable to come to an agreement, consider getting some more feedback on existing concepts and synthesizing ideas together into a new concept.
