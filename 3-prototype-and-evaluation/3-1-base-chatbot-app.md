# 3-1 Base Chatbot App

## Objective

Build your base chatbot. Let's call it a _minimum viable chatbot_. This is a twist on a _minimum viable product_.

> **From the Lean Startup Principles:** "A core component of Lean Startup methodology is the build-measure-learn feedback loop. The first step is figuring out the problem that needs to be solved and then developing a minimum viable product \(MVP\) to begin the process of learning as quickly as possible. Once the MVP is established, a startup can work on tuning the engine. This will involve measurement and learning and must include actionable metrics that can demonstrate cause and effect question."

Your _minimum viable chatbot_ will allow you to test a functioning version of your chatbot to provide guidance on the development details you will need later.

## Instructions

1. Review the template code demonstrated [here on CodePen](https://codepen.io/jlyst/project/editor/ZqdVNx). 

   > The following steps assume you are using Editey in your Google Drive, but you can use any code editor you prefer.

2. Download and unzip the files for the template. The latest files can be found in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B78R6qBzYFtZZmdYX2I0aHFXZTA).
3. Create a folder in Google Drive for your chatbot and create a new Editey workspace. If needed, you can use [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eWraL0zTOZNGMtN_OL4FThP-lA0TzqHsF0KtQ53L_JQ/edit?usp=sharing) for getting an empty Editey workspace started.
4. Verify that you are now able to preview the index.html file and have a functioning \(but minimal\) chatbot. 

NOTE: You will notice a file `chatbotRiveScript.html`. This file is not actually `HTML`, but it is a very important file that hold the chatbot script you will be editing. The extension `.html` is used so that it can be opened in a separate tab with Editey for development. Plain text editors in Google Drive are hard to come by. ☹️
