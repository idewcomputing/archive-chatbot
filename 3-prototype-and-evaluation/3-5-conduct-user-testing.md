# 3-5 Conduct User Testing

## Objective

Conduct user-testing on your prototype and record findings.

## Instructions

For each of at least five participants in your study, follow the instructions below. You are basically demonstrating the straight-line paths you have designed in your chatbot, while stopping at each step to get feedback. Encourage each participant to "think-aloud", where he or she is just sharing thoughts on the process.

This may be uncomfortable for some, so consider how to put them at ease. Take notes on the details of his or her responses. It is recommended that at least two team members conduct each session.

**It is recommended that you use a copy of your chatbot's straight-line dialogue to take notes at each step.**

1. Provide the background of your project to the participant. Explain what your team is designing and that you would like feedback on how it works and any value it provides. Explain that you are not testing his or her abilities, but only testing how to make the chatbot more clear and engaging. 
2. Show the initial chatbot message on the screen and ask the participant what they think may be a logical next step. 
3. Demonstrate the next step a user could take towards one of your three tasks by typing the expected input. You are just leading the participant step-by-step down your prototype's straight-line path.
4. Ask if chatbot's response is clear, and if she would rephrase the chatbot's response. Encourage the participant to "think-aloud" without feeling they are being judged.
5. Ask how she might respond to the chatbot now. Discuss and take notes.
6. Continue with your straight-line path step by step to the end of the task, asking for feedback and discussing details along the way.
7. Do the same for the other two tasks your chatbot can complete.
