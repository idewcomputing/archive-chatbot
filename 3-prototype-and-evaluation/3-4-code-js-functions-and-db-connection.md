# 3-4 Code JS Functions and DB Connection

## Objective

Code the javascript functions and database access needed for your chatbot to function as expected.

## Instructions

1. Review the code examples in [Using Functions](../code/using-functions.md) and the directions for ["Connecting a Database Using Google Sheets"](../code/connecting-a-database-using-google-sheets.md) from the _Code Examples_ section of this GitBook to get started.
2. Next, review [A Round Trip to the Database](../code/a-round-trip-to-the-db-and-back.md) to see how the chatbot script, functions, and database can work together. **Consider using the code in this example as your starting point in your chatbot.**
3. **Create the core functions in your chatbot and iterate !!!** Start with very simple functions and get them working first. Then incrementally add complexity as you go along.

## âœ“ Deliverable

Be prepared to demonstrate and discuss your progress on a weekly basis.

### A Recommended Extra Step

After you feel comfortable with how functions and your database work, we recommend that you follow the advice in [Placing Functions in a Separate JavaScript File](../code/placing-js-functions-in-a-separate-file.md). Doing so will help keep your development organized, but it is not required.
