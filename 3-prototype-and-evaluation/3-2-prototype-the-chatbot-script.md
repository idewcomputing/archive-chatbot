# 3-2 Prototype the Chatbot Script

## Objective

Code a _"straight-line dialogue"_ using the three sample dialogues you developed in [2-3](../2-concept-development-and-solution-development/2-3-sample-dialogue.md). By _"straight-line dialogue"_ we mean that you will not code all the various paths people may take with your chatbot, only a single instance of a dialogue that you believe represents the intent of your chatbot tasks. Imagine a "perfect user" that interacts with the chatbot exactly how you want. Get this working first, then we can move on.

## Instructions

1. Create three topics \(your three tasks\) by [Adding Topics to Your Chatbot](https://cxd.gitbooks.io/chatbot/content/code-examples/adding-topics-to-your-chatbot.html). This will allow different team members to work on each of the chatbot tasks.
2. Define the script for the entry point for users before they are "sent" to a particular topic \(task\)
3. Each team member can provide the chatbot script for a task.
4. You will need to "fake" some elements temporarily in the script, like when your chatbot will go search your database. Use your best judgement to put in meaningful placeholders.
5. You can also check out the [Chatbot Mods CodePen](https://codepen.io/jlyst/project/editor/ZGgQjm#) for live examples.

> Later you will demonstrate this simple and straight-forward interaction to other people and get feedback. The feedback will inform you about the various paths you will need to address later when developing the full script.

## âœ“ Deliverable

Demonstrate that your chatbot can take your "straigh-line path" through your three tasks.
