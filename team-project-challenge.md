# Team Project Challenge

## The Challenge

Research, design, and develop a chatbot that serves the needs and interests of people in a thoughtful way. You will be able to choose the target audience for the project based on the purpose of your chatbot. But it should be accessible to the general population, in order that they can evaluate it and enjoy your great work. Make something that solves a particular problem that also generally impresses your classmates, family, and larger community and motivates them to learn more about computing.

## Project Requirements

* Your chatbot will have at least 3 [_Rivescript topics_](https://www.rivescript.com/docs/tutorial#topics) incorporated.
* Your chatbot script will contain at least 40 well-formed [triggers](https://www.rivescript.com/docs/tutorial#triggers).
* You will incorporate a back-end database using Google sheets with tabletop.js, to manage a glossary or library of data needed for your chatbot. \(Similar to what we did with Trivia App\)
* You will use at least one javascript function to help provide dynamic responses to user inputs--like a counter, calculation, timer etc.
* Your chatbot interface provides a simple, but unique, visual and audio experience that is clear, usable, and engaging on a desktop computer or mobile device.
